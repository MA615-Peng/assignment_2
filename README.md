In this update, I've made suggested edits to plot1.  
1. Keep the data as numeric rather than character values allows for legible axes
2. Create line plots rather than bars and lines, so the lines don't get lost or overlooked because of the prominence of the bars.   
  
A potential next step would be to improve the legend. I couldn't figure out how to show all options in the legend. I think you would need to pivot_longer, and make a single column called percent and a second column called indicator (sanitation or rural) but I'm not 100% sure of this. 

red triangle = Armenia Sanitation  
blue triangle = China Sanitation  
red circle = Armenia Rural Population  
blue circle = China Rural Population
